      <h1> About Us</h1>
      <p>Today, costs of SAT prep are astronomical with classes (like those hosted by Princeton Review or Kaplan) and tutoring often costing anywhere from hundreds to thousands of dollars. Most high school students and their families lack the financial capability to attend these classes or hire tutors. Many students often use test-prep books to prepare, however still struggle due to the lack of human guidance and feedback. Recognizing this problem while also realizing the importance of the SAT when it comes to college admissions, Kevin Ren and Siddharth Venigalla, two Maggie L. Walker Governor&rsquo;s School students, decided to found AcePrep. The goal of AcePrep is to provide free SAT prep to students in underserved areas who lack the access to quality test aid. Our organization has partnered with numerous schools in the Richmond city area to provide SAT prep to their students through after school sessions. An important aspect of our organization is that our tutoring is provided by high school students for other high school students. This factor makes us unique due to the fact that we have keen insight on the test because we have taken it several times and performed well on it. As a result, this allows us to provide valuable test tips and strategies to students while also maintaining a comfortable peer to peer learning environment for our students.</p>

          <p>Hey, I’m Norris. I’m a junior at Matoaca High School in Chesterfield. Ultimately, I want to earn a Ph.D in Electrical Engineering and research quantum computing. I love practicing Spanish, reading, and the research program I partake in at VCU. I managed to improve my score almost 300 points over the course of a year with self-guided tutoring. I hope to foster similar success with those in my area.</p>
